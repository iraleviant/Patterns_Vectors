 the following sources cite anarchism as a political_philosophy
 while anti - statism is central , anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical_organisation in the conduct of all human relations . anarchism is usually considered a far - left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti - authoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism or participatory_economics .
 anarchism does_not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy . many types and traditions of anarchism exist , not all of which are mutually_exclusive . anarchist schools of thought can differ_fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme_individualism to complete collectivism . strains of anarchism have often been divided_into the categories of social and individualist_anarchism or similar dual classifications .
 the word is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix - ism , themselves derived respectively from the greek , i . e . anarchy ( from , anarchos , meaning one without rulers from the privative_prefix ἀν - ( an - , i . e . without ) and , archos , i . e . leader , ruler ( cf . archon or , arkhē , i . e . authority , sovereignty , realm , magistracy ) ) and the suffix or ( - ismos , - isma , from the verbal_infinitive suffix - ίζειν , - izein ) . the first known use of this word was in . various_factions within the french_revolution labelled opponents as anarchists ( as robespierre did the hébertists ) although few shared many views of later anarchists . there would be many revolutionaries of the early_nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next_generation , such_as william_godwin and wilhelm_weitling , but they did_not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs .
 the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre - joseph_proudhon , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid - nineteenth_century . since the s , and beginning in france , the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost_exclusively in this sense until the s in the united_states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united_states . on the other_hand , some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free - market philosophy only , referring to free - market_anarchism as libertarian_anarchism .
 document by william_everard
 the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th_century bc among the works of taoist_philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao_jingyan . zhuangzi ' s philosophy has_been described by various sources as anarchist . zhuangzi wrote a petty_thief is put in jail . a great becomes a ruler of a nation . diogenes of sinope and the cynics , as well as their contemporary zeno of citium , the founder of stoicism , also introduced similar topics . jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition . georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus_christ and . . . the first anarchist society was that of the apostles . in early islamic history , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil_war over the caliphate , where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society .
 the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de_la boétie wrote in his most_famous work the discourse on voluntary_servitude what some historians_consider an important anarchist precedent . the radical protestant_christian gerrard_winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th_century in england . the term anarchist first entered the english language in , during the english civil_war , as a term of abuse , used by royalists against their roundhead opponents . by the time of the french_revolution some , such_as the enragés , began to use the term positively , in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power , seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic . by the turn of the th_century , the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative_connotation .
 modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment , particularly jean - jacques_rousseau ' s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
 as part of the political_turmoil of the s in the wake of the french_revolution , william_godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought . godwin was , according to peter_kropotkin , the first to formulate the political and economical_conceptions of anarchism , even_though he did_not give that name to the ideas developed in his work , while godwin attached his anarchist_ideas to an early edmund_burke .
 godwin is generally_regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as ' philosophical_anarchism ' . he argued in political justice ( ) that government has an inherently malevolent_influence on society , and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance . he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither_away as an unnecessary force . although he did_not accord the state with moral_legitimacy , he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power . rather , he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution .
 his aversion to the imposition of a rules - based society led him to denounce , as a manifestation of the people ' s ' mental_enslavement ' , the foundations of law , property_rights and even the institution of marriage . he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually_beneficial method of social organisation . in each case , government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance_with the full and free exercise of private judgement .
 the french pierre - joseph_proudhon is regarded_as the first self - proclaimed_anarchist , a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work , what is property ? , published in . it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist_theory . he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society , where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its_own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their_own interests . his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order . in what is property ? proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft . in this work , he opposed the institution of decreed property ( propriété ) , where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish . he contrasted this with what he called possession , or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use . later , however , proudhon added that property is liberty and argued_that it was a bulwark_against state power . his opposition to the state , organised religion , and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists , and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time .
 the anarcho - communist joseph_déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian . unlike pierre - joseph_proudhon , he argued_that , it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature . in in germany the post - hegelian_philosopher max_stirner published the book , the ego and its_own , which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist_anarchism . french anarchists active in the revolution included anselme_bellegarrigue , ernest coeurderoy , joseph_déjacque and pierre joseph_proudhon .
 first international and the paris_commune
 opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion , and allied_himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists .
 in europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long - term social_upheaval as groups carried_out nationalist_uprisings . after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took_advantage of the divided groups of socialists , anarchists , liberals , and nationalists , to prevent further revolt . in spain ramón de_la sagra established the anarchist journal el_porvenir in la_coruña in which was inspired_by proudhon´s ideas . the catalan politician francesc_pi i_margall became the principal translator of proudhon ' s works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party . according to george_woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting_effect on the development of spanish anarchism after , but before that time proudhonian_ideas , as interpreted by pi , already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist_movement which sprang_up in the early ' s . according to the encyclopædia_britannica during the spanish revolution of , pi y_margall attempted to establish a decentralised , or cantonalist , political system on proudhonian_lines .
 in the international_workingmen ' s association ( sometimes_called the first international ) united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon , blanquists , philadelphes , english trade_unionists , socialists and social_democrats . due to its links to active workers ' movements , the international became a significant organisation . karl_marx became a leading_figure in the international and a member of its general council . proudhon ' s followers , the mutualists , opposed marx ' s state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . woodcock also reports that the american individualist_anarchists lysander_spooner and william b . greene had_been members of the first international . in , following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom ( lpf ) , russian revolutionary mikhail_bakunin and his collectivist_anarchist associates joined the first international ( which had decided not to get involved with the lpf ) . they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property .
 at first , the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary_socialist direction . subsequently , the international became polarised into two camps , with marx and bakunin as their_respective figureheads . mikhail_bakunin characterised marx ' s ideas as centralist and predicted that , if a marxist party came to power , its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought_against . anarchist_historian george_woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the paris_commune , and in the general council called only a special conference in london . one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy , while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the fédération_romande – was used to avoid inviting bakunin ' s swiss supporters . thus only a tiny_minority of anarchists was present , and the general council ' s resolutions_passed almost_unanimously . most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers . in , the conflict_climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress , where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled_from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new_york . in response , the federalist sections formed their_own international at the st . imier_congress , adopting a revolutionary_anarchist programme .
 the paris_commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from march ( more formally , from march ) to may . the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco - prussian_war . anarchists participated_actively in the establishment of the paris_commune . they included louise_michel , the reclus brothers , and eugene varlin ( the latter murdered in the repression afterwards ) . as for the reforms_initiated by the commune , such_as the re - opening of workplaces as co - operatives , anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised . . . moreover , the commune ' s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical_ideas . indeed , the commune ' s vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin ' s and proudhon ' s ideas ( proudhon , like bakunin , had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in . . . and for federation of communes ) . thus both economically and politically the paris_commune was heavily_influenced by anarchist_ideas . george_woodcock states
 organised labour
 the anti - authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho - syndicalists , seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour . in , the federation of organized trades and labor_unions ( fotlu ) of the united_states and canada unanimously set may , as the date by which the eight - hour work day would become standard .
 of the executed_anarchists of chicago after the haymarket_affair . the haymarket_affair is generally_considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances .
 in response , unions across the united_states prepared a general strike in support of the event . on may , in chicago , a fight broke_out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket_line , and two workers died when police opened_fire upon the crowd . the next_day , may , anarchists staged a rally at chicago ' s haymarket_square . a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally , killing an officer . in the ensuing_panic , police opened_fire on the crowd and each_other . seven police_officers and at_least four workers were killed . eight anarchists directly and indirectly_related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer . the men became international political celebrities among the labour_movement . four of the men were executed and a fifth committed_suicide prior to his own execution . the incident became known as the haymarket_affair , and was a setback for the labour_movement and the struggle for the eight - hour day . in a second attempt , this time international in scope , to organise for the eight - hour day was made . the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the haymarket_affair . although it had initially been conceived as a once - off event , by the following year the celebration of international workers ' day on may day had become firmly_established as an international worker ' s holiday .
 in , the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries , among which were important figures of the anarchist_movement , including errico_malatesta , pierre_monatte , luigi_fabbri , benoît_broutchoux , emma_goldman , rudolf_rocker , and christiaan_cornelissen . various themes were treated during the congress , in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist_movement , popular education issues , the general strike or antimilitarism . a central debate concerned the relation_between anarchism and syndicalism ( or trade_unionism ) . malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue , as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution , while malatesta did_not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient . he thought that the trade - union movement was reformist and even conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti - worker the phenomenon of professional union officials . malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain_from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
 the spanish workers federation in was the first major anarcho - syndicalist_movement anarchist trade_union federations were of special importance in spain . the most_successful was the confederación_nacional del_trabajo ( national confederation of labour cnt ) , founded in . before the s , the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics , attracting . million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish_civil war . the cnt was affiliated_with the international workers association , a federation of anarcho - syndicalist_trade unions founded in , with delegates_representing two million workers from countries in europe and latin_america . in latin_america in particular the anarchists quickly_became active in organising craft and industrial_workers throughout south and central_america , and until the early s most of the trade_unions in mexico , brazil , peru , chile , and argentina were anarcho - syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish c . n . t . as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible_for this situation . the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación_obrera regional argentina . . . it grew_quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million , which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions .
 propaganda of the deed and illegalism
 anarchist_luigi galleani . his followers , known as galleanists , carried_out a series of bombings and assassination_attempts from to in what they saw as attacks on ' tyrants ' and ' enemies of the people '
 some anarchists , such_as johann most , advocated publicising violent_acts of retaliation_against counter - revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda . scholars such_as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass_murder , but targeted_killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner_sympathy from the population , such_as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed . however , most himself once_boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents . therefore , massacres of the enemies of the people must_be set in motion . most is best_known for a pamphlet published in the science of revolutionary warfare , a how - to manual on the subject of making explosives , based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new_jersey .
 by the s , people inside and outside the anarchist_movement began to use the slogan , propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings , regicides , and tyrannicides . from onwards , the russian counterparts of these anti - syndicalist_anarchist - communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ' expropriations ' . illegalism as a practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ( propaganda by the deed ) and the anarchist_burglars ( individual_reappropriation ) expressed their desperation and their personal , violent rejection of an intolerable society . moreover , they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt . . france ' s bonnot_gang was the most_famous group to embrace_illegalism .
 however , as soon as , important figures in the anarchist_movement distanced_themselves from such individual acts . peter_kropotkin thus wrote that year in le_révolté that a structure based on centuries of history cannot_be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite . a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these_sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action , for example through the trade_union movement . the anarcho - syndicalist , fernand_pelloutier , argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour_movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter .
 state repression ( including the infamous french lois_scélérates ) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these_kinds of tactics , although reciprocally state repression , in the first place , may have played a role in these isolated acts . the dismemberment of the french socialist_movement , into many groups and , following the suppression of the paris_commune , the execution and exile of many communards to penal_colonies , favoured individualist political expression and acts . historian benedict_anderson thus writes in march the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months . then versailles seized the moment to attack and , in one horrifying week , executed roughly , communards or suspected_sympathizers , a number higher_than those killed in the recent war or during robespierre ' s ' terror ' of – . more_than , were jailed or deported to places like new_caledonia . thousands of others fled to belgium , england , italy , spain and the united_states . in , stringent_laws were passed that ruled_out all possibilities of organising on the left . not till was there a general_amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards . meanwhile , the third republic found itself strong_enough to renew and reinforce louis_napoleon ' s imperialist_expansion – in indochina , africa , and oceania . many of france ' s leading_intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune ( courbet was its quasi - minister of culture , rimbaud and pissarro were active propagandists ) or were sympathetic to it . the ferocious repression of and thereafter , was probably the key_factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad . according to some analysts , in post - war germany , the prohibition of the communist_party ( kdp ) and thus of institutional far - left political organization may also , in the same_manner , have played a role in the creation of the red_army faction .
 numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist_movement , including tsar_alexander ii of russia , president sadi_carnot of france , empress_elisabeth of austria , king_umberto i of italy , president william_mckinley of the united_states , king carlos i of portugal and king_george i of greece . mckinley ' s assassin leon_czolgosz claimed to have_been influenced_by anarchist and feminist emma_goldman .
 russian_revolution and other uprisings of the s
 with members of the anarchist revolutionary_insurrectionary army of ukraine
 anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions , and were initially enthusiastic_about the bolshevik_revolution . however , following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left - wing opposition , the conflict culminated in the kronstadt_rebellion , which the new government repressed . anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned , driven underground or joined the victorious_bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine . there , in the free territory , they fought in the civil_war against the whites ( a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution ) and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary_insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor_makhno , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months .
 expelled american anarchists emma_goldman and alexander_berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt_uprising , before they left russia . both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia , criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised . for them , bakunin ' s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true .
 the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil_war did serious_damage to anarchist_movements internationally . many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist_parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements . in france and the united_states , for example , members of the major syndicalist_movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international .
 the revolutionary wave of – saw the active_participation of anarchists in varying_degrees of protagonism . in the german uprising known as the german revolution of – which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav_landauer , silvio_gesell and erich_mühsam had important leadership_positions within the revolutionary councilist structures . in the italian events known as the biennio_rosso the anarcho - syndicalist_trade union unione_sindacale italiana grew to , members and the influence of the italian_anarchist union ( , members plus umanita_nova , its daily paper ) grew accordingly . . . anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces . in the mexican_revolution the mexican liberal_party was established and during the early s it led a series of military_offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja_california with the leadership of anarcho - communist ricardo_flores magón .
 in paris , the dielo_truda group of russian anarchist exiles , which included nestor_makhno , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism . their manifesto , called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists ( draft ) , was supported . platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity_movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist_communists of north_america . synthesis_anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives . in the s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien_faure . it is the main principle behind the anarchist_federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist_federations .
 conflicts with european fascist_regimes
 in the s and s , the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism ' s conflict with the state . italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists . italian_anarchists played a key_role in the anti - fascist_organisation arditi_del popolo , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions , and achieved some success in their activism , such_as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august . the veteran italian_anarchist , luigi_fabbri , was one of the first critical_theorists of fascism , describing it as the preventive counter - revolution . in france , where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february riots , anarchists divided over a united front policy .
 anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world_war ii . in germany the anarchist erich_mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early_morning hours of february , within a few_hours after the reichstag_fire in berlin . joseph_goebbels , the nazi_propaganda minister , labelled him as one of those jewish subversives . over the next seventeen months , he would be imprisoned in the concentration_camps at sonnenburg , brandenburg and finally , oranienburg . on february , mühsam was transferred to the concentration_camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of july , mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards , his battered_corpse found hanging in a latrine the next_morning .
 spanish revolution
 in spain , the national anarcho - syndicalist_trade union confederación_nacional del_trabajo initially_refused to join a popular front electoral_alliance , and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right_wing election victory . but in , the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped_bring the popular front back to power . months_later , conservative members of the military , with the support of minority extreme - right parties , responded with an attempted_coup , causing the spanish_civil war ( – ) . in response to the army rebellion , an anarchist - inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed_militias , took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land . but even before the fascist victory in , the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter_struggle with the stalinists , who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet_union . according to noam_chomsky , the communists were mainly responsible_for the destruction of the spanish_anarchists . not just in catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere . the communists basically acted as the police_force of the security system of the republic and were very_much opposed to the anarchists , partially because stalin still  and hoped at that time to have some_kind of pact with western countries against hitler . that , of course , failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic . they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves . the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers ' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish_civil war in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more_broadly libertarian_socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years , primarily catalonia , aragon , andalusia , and parts of the levante . much of spain ' s economy was put under worker control in anarchist_strongholds like catalonia , the figure was as high as % , but lower in areas with heavy communist_party of spain influence , as the soviet - allied party actively_resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment . factories were run through worker committees , agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes . anarchist_historian sam_dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at_least indirectly in the spanish revolution , which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless_society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history . spanish communist_party - led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident_marxists and anarchists . the prominent italian_anarchist camillo_berneri , who volunteered to fight_against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated_with the and spanish communist_party . the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist_forces by the last non - francoist mayor of the city , the anarchist_melchor rodríguez_garcía .

 anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis_anarchism and platformism took importance once_again especially in the anarchist_movements of italy and france . the mexican anarchist_federation was established in after the anarchist_federation of the centre united with the anarchist_federation of the federal district . in the early s , the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged_into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba ( cuban libertarian association ) . from to , the bulgarian anarchist_communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement , but was repressed by the new communist_regime . in in france the fédération_anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade_union confédération_nationale du_travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione_anarchica italiana was founded in italy . korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september and in the japanese anarchist_federation was founded . an international anarchist congress with delegates from across_europe was held in paris in may . after world_war ii , an appeal in the fraye_arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them . by february , the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a large - scale operation . the federation of libertarian_socialists was founded in germany in and rudolf_rocker wrote for its organ , die_freie gesellschaft , which survived until . in the uruguayan anarchist_federation was founded . in the anarcho - communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine
