"

 there are many similarities in both illnesses , the most common being the cause . there seems to be a common_occurence of sexual and/or physical and emotional_abuse in direct relation to eating_disorders ( though not all people living with eating_disorders are survivors of abuse ) .

 depression . the eating_disorder sometimes causes the depression or the depression can lead to the eating_disorder . all in all , eating_disorders are very complex emotional issues - - though they may seem to be nothing more_than a dangerously obsessive weight concern on the surface , for most men and women suffering with an eating_disorder there are deeper emotional conflicts to be resolved .

 the following is considered the " text book " definition of anorexia_nervosa to assist doctors in making a clinical_diagnosis . . . it is in no way representative of what a sufferer feels or experiences in living with the illness .

 it is important to note that you can still suffer from anorexia even if one of the below signs is not present ( also see the signs and symptoms section ) . in other_words , if you think you have anorexia , it '_s dangerous to read the diagnostic_criteria and think " i don_' t have one of the symptoms , so i must not be anorexic " .

 refusal to maintain body_weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height ( e . g . , weight_loss leading to maintenance of body_weight less_than % of that expected or failure to make expected weight_gain during period of growth , leading to body_weight less_than % of that expected ) .

 " . . . the reflection staring back at me is not what you see . . . my guilt running the need to destroy my duration . . . forcing me to seek guidance on an empty plate of stolen dreams and fractured rainbows . . . "

 " . . . i sense a stranger filling this silent room with anguish . . . a silence that rattles against the windows leaving me so cold and numb . . . and somehow . . . this feeling i do not understand is my best_friend and enemy all wrapped_up in one . . . "

 the following is considered the " text book " definition of bulimia_nervosa to assist doctors in making a clinical_diagnosis . . . it is in no way representative of what a sufferer feels or experiences in living with the illness .

 it is important to note that you can still suffer from bulimia even if one of the below signs is not present ( also see the signs and symptoms section ) . in other_words , if you think you have bulimia , it '_s dangerous to read the diagnostic_criteria and think " i don_' t have one of the symptoms , so i must not be bulimic " .

 recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight_gain , such as self - induced_vomiting misuse of laxatives , diuretics , enemas , or other medications fasting or excessive exercise .

 " . . . intimidated by any change . . . in a brief moment there might be too_much vulnerability and i '_ll be left wide open to really hurt . . . all these things hanging over me , weighing me down . . . what will it take to make the darkness not so dark ? "

 people suffering with compulsive_overeating have what is characterized as an " addiction " to food , using food and eating as a way to hide from their emotions , to fill a void they feel inside , and to cope_with daily stresses and problems in their lives .

 people suffering with this eating_disorder tend to be overweight , are usually aware that their eating_habits are abnormal , but find little comfort because of society '_s tendency to stereotype the " overweight " individual . words like , " just go on a diet " are as emotionally devestating to a person suffering compulsive_overeating as " just eat " can be to a person suffering anorexia . a person suffering as a compulsive_overeater is at health risk for a heart_attack , high blood - pressure and cholesterol , kidney_disease and/or failure , arthritis and bone deterioration , and stroke .

 i suppose it is ironic that i work at a hospital . i was married to an alcoholic . . . how nice it would be to have a simple addiction like booze . . . you give it up and you are recovering . but you have to eat . well i eat . . . when i ' m hungry . . . when i ' m full . . . when i ' m anxious . . . when i ' m happy . . . when i ' m sad . . . well you get the idea . food , the friend that never fails .

 every diet has failed . i_am a lifer on weight_watchers , i have been through nutra system . but it '_s not about the weight . . . it '_s about the inability to deal with feelings and emotions . . . about using a bowl of pasta or a pound of m&m '_s as a narcotic to stem the pain .

 i cry because it makes me overweight and no one sees the real me inside . i try to show the real me and i_think that people don_' t like me because i_am overweight . another catch or chicken and egg thing . i see my_son gaining_weight and i grieve . i want out . . . but then i realize that there is no out . . . only control . . . and control is harder than being in our out .

 men and women living with binge_eating disorder suffer a combination of symptoms similar to those of compulsive_overeaters and bulimia . the sufferer periodically goes on large binges , consuming an unusually_large quantity of food in a short period of time ( less_than hours ) uncontrollably , eating until they are uncomfortably full . the weight of each individual is usually characterized as above average or overweight , and sufferers tend to have a more difficult time losing_weight and maintaining average healthy weights . unlike with bulimia , they do not purge following a binge episode .

 reasons for binge_eating can be similar to those of compulsive_overeating using binges as a way to hide from their emotions , to fill a void they feel inside , and to cope_with daily stresses and problems in their lives . binging can be used as a way to keep people away , to subconsciously maintain an overweight appearance to cator to society '_s sad stigma " if i ' m fat , no one will like me , " as each person suffering may feel undeserving of love . as with bulimia , binging can also be used as self - punishment for doing " bad " things , or for feeling badly about themselves .

 it is important to note that you can still suffer from bed even if one of the below signs is not present . in other_words , if you think you have bed , it '_s dangerous to read the diagnostic_criteria and think " i don_' t have one of the symptoms , so i must not have it " .

 the binge_eating is not associated_with the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (_eg , purging , fasting , excessive exercise ) and does_not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia_nervosa or bulimia_nervosa .

 my first memory of my disorder was when i was . one night after dinner i found_myself rummaging_through the garbage to finish off what no one else wanted . no one was around . i was very secretive about it . but was my way of having control in my life . my parents were always critical of who i was and my body , especially .

 i ' d eat in secret , gorging myself with more food than necessary , way beyond the point of feeling full . guilt , anxiety and fear would always ensue . feelings of rage , hatred and loathing would follow or severe_depression with suicidal_tendencies . you know it '_s ironic i understand my disease enough to know that it all stems_from issues of control ( feeling out of control and abusing food to regain it ) . but i_am so out of control when i abuse food , that it just becomes a vicious_cycle day after day after day .

 provided , that for the fiscal_year ending the thirtieth_day of june , one thousand nine_hundred ninety - nine , expenditures are authorized from collections rather_than pursuant to an appropriation of the legislature .

 an act to amend article three , chapter twelve of the code of west_virginia , one thousand nine_hundred thirty - one , as amended , by adding thereto a new section , designated section twenty , relating to payment of funds of county boards of education , county commissions , municipal_corporations by electronic or wire_transfer , inclusion of appropriate electronic remittance voucher information and specifying effective_date .

 an act to amend and reenact section seventeen , article seven - a , chapter eighteen of the code of west_virginia , one thousand nine_hundred thirty - one , as amended , relating to increasing the service credit within the teachers retirement system for teachers who serve as an officer with a statewide professional association and providing that members elected to public office be credited for time served in discharging legislative duties .

 provided , however , that a transfer of out - of - state service shall be is prohibited if such the service is used to obtain a retirement benefit from another retirement system provided further , that salaries paid to members for service prior to entrance into the retirement system shall not be used to compute the average final salary of such the member under the retirement system .

 provided , that the period of service credit granted for such that service shall not exceed six ten_years provided , however , that a member or retired teacher who is serving or has served as an officer of a statewide professional teaching association shall make deposits to the teachers retirement board , for the time of any such absence , in an amount double the amount which he or she would have contributed in his or her regular assignment for a like period of time .

 in any legal proceeding , nothing in the application or the rules of evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of an electronic record or electronic_signature into evidence solely on the ground that it is an electronic record or electronic_signature , or , on the grounds that it is not in its original form or is not an original .

 this act requires the state board to establish goals for professional_development and to provide a process to coordinate program delivery through the state department of education , regional educational service agencies , and the center for professional_development to create the strategic staff development fund with funds that accrue in the general revenue fund to develop an assessment program and an accountability program to establish the reading excellence accelerates deserving students program to establish a process for improving education to establish a system of education performance audits to designate certain schools with more_than a casual deficit as having nonapproval_status to appoint a team of improvement consultants before the state board may intervene in the operation of a county school system to provide for the targeting of resources to improve the teaching and learning process to create the west_virginia staff development advisory_council to create regional staff development councils in each regional educational service agency to increase the allowance for transportation costs .

 virginia and create a " master_plan " for professional_development based in part on approved professional_development plans from resas , the center for professional_development , and the department of education .

 the state board shall review the proposed plans and shall return the proposed plans to the respective agencies on or before the first day of january , each year , noting whether the proposed plan is approved or is not approved in whole or in part . if a proposed plan is not approved in whole , the state board shall note its objections to the proposed plan or to the parts of the proposed plan not approved and may suggest improvements or specific modifications , additions or deletions to more fully address the goals or eliminate_duplication . an agency whose proposed plan is not wholly approved shall revise the plan to satisfy the objections of the state board or state the reasons_why revisions cannot be made to satisfy any or all of the objections and resubmit the proposal to the state board as soon as possible . state board approval of the professional_development plans of the center for professional_development and the regional educational service agencies is required prior to implementation of the plans .

 no county shall expand any system either through the purchase of additional software or hardware that does_not advance the goals and implementation of the uniform integrated regional computer information system as recommended by the state board provided , that nothing contained_herein shall prevent the state superintendent from granting a one - year extension to those counties projected to have budget_deficits for the school year beginning on the first day of july , one thousand nine_hundred ninety - four .

 any remaining funds transferred to the strategic staff development fund during the fiscal_year shall be carried over for use in the same manner the next fiscal_year and shall be separate and apart_from , and in addition to , the transfer of funds from the general school fund for the next fiscal_year .

 the legislature further finds that not all students are financially able to pay for summer school , nor do all county schools hold summer school . it is , therefore , the purpose of this section to help the county boards to provide , either individually or cooperatively , free summer school and summer school transportation for those students in kindergarten_through grade four who did_not perform at grade_level during the regular school year . it also is the purpose of this section to help students in kindergarten_through grade four who are identified as being in danger of failing to read at grade_level by the end of the school year to receive intensive reading_instruction during their regularly_scheduled reading time throughout the regular school year .

 the state board is not required to promulgate new rules if legislative rules meeting the requirements of article three - b , chapter twenty - nine - a of this code have been filed with the office of the secretary of state before the effective_date of this section .

 the state board shall establish by rule in accordance_with the provisions of article three - b , chapter twenty - nine - a of this code , a system of education performance audits which measures the quality of education and the preparation of students based on the standards and measures of student , school and school system performance and processes , including , but not limited to , the standards and measures set_forth in subsections_( c ) and ( d ) of this section . the system of education performance audits shall assist the state board in ensuring that the standards and measures established pursuant to this section are , at a minimum , being met and that a thorough and efficient system of schools is being provided . the system of education performance audits shall include ( ) the assessment of student , school and school system performance and the processes in place in schools and school systems which enable student performance ( ) the review of school and school system unified improvement plans and ( ) the periodic , random_unannounced on - site review of school and school system performance and compliance with the standards .

 the office of education performance audits shall report the findings of the on - site reviews to the state board for inclusion in the

' ίζειν , - izein  anarchism  trade_union confédération_nationale  &_jerk ' is a political_philosophy that advocates self - governed societies based on voluntary institutions . these are often described as stateless_societies , although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non - hierarchical or free associations . anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , and harmful &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk &_jerk.
 the following sources cite anarchism as a political_philosophy
the correlation_between astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute_magnitude and diameter is
 a \left ( \frac}_\right ) ^ ,
 where a is the astronomical albedo , d is the diameter in kilometers , and h is the absolute_magnitude .
 examples of terrestrial albedo effects
 although the albedo–temperature effect is best_known in colder , whiter regions on earth , the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year - round illumination is greater . the maximum is additionally in the northern_hemisphere , varying between three and twelve degrees north . the minima are found in the subtropical_regions of the northern and southern_hemispheres , beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination .
 insolation effects
 the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend_on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar_irradiance ) high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation , where areas such_as the sahara_desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation . tropical and sub - tropical_rainforest areas have low_albedo , and are much_hotter than their temperate_forest counterparts , which have lower insolation . because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes .
 arctic_regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb , effectively cooling the earth . this has_been a concern since arctic ice and snow has_been melting at higher_rates due to higher_temperatures , creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker ( being water or ground which is darker color ) and reflects less heat back into space . this feedback_loop results in a reduced albedo effect .
 climate and weather
 albedo affects climate by determining how_much radiation a planet absorbs . the uneven_heating of earth from albedo variations between land , ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather .
 albedo–temperature feedback
 when an area ' s albedo changes due to snowfall , a snow–temperature feedback results . a layer of snowfall increases local albedo , reflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling . in principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( e . g . , a warm air mass ) , the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow–temperature feedback . however , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm air_masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting . when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such_as grass or soil , the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus_reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating .
 snow albedo is highly_variable , ranging_from as high as . for freshly_fallen snow , to about . for melting_snow , and as low as . for dirty snow . over antarctica they average a little more_than . . if a marginally snow - covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice–albedo positive_feedback ) . the albedo of freshly_fallen snow is far higher_than that of the sea water when the ice caps melt due to rising_temperatures , it exposes the sea water which absorbs the energy rather_than reflect it . this , in turn , causes the sea water to heat up increasing the melting of sea ice which is another example of a positive_feedback . cryoconite , powdery windblown_dust containing soot , sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice_sheets .
 hence , small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates , which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow - covered areas through remote_sensing techniques rather_than applying a single value over broad regions .
 small - scale effects
 albedo works on a smaller_scale , too . in sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light - coloured_clothes reflect it better , thus_allowing some control over body_temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing .

 albedo can affect the electrical_energy output of solar_photovoltaic devices . for example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences_between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar_photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated_amorphous silicon ( a - si h ) and crystalline_silicon ( c - si ) - based compared to traditional spectral - integrated albedo predictions . research showed impacts of over % . more recently , the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular_reflectivity of commonly_occurring surface materials ( both human - made and natural ) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic_system topologies industrial ( solar_farms ) , commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched - roof applications .
 because forests generally have a low_albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible_spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ) , some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate_impacts of deforestation ) . in the case of evergreen_forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling_effect . trees also impact climate in extremely_complicated ways through evapotranspiration . the water_vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , acts a strong greenhouse_gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends_greatly on local climate
 in seasonally snow - covered zones , winter albedos of treeless_areas are % to % higher_than nearby forested_areas because snow does_not cover the trees as readily . deciduous_trees have an albedo value of about . to . whereas coniferous_trees have a value of about . to . .
 studies by the hadley_centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon_sequestration on planting forests . they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high_latitudes ( e . g . , siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming .
 water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials . the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel_equations ( see graph ) .
 at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely ) . the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this . at small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity - vs . - incident - angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle .
 although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such_as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator ( early_morning , late_afternoon , and near the poles ) . however , as mentioned_above , waviness causes an appreciable_reduction . because light specularly_reflected from water does_not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to have a very low_albedo in spite of its high_reflectivity at high angles of incident light .
 note that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is foamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities . fresh ' black ' ice exhibits fresnel_reflection .
 snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to . .
 cloud_albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric_temperatures . different_types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching . . on any given day , about half of earth is covered by clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water . clouds keep earth cool by reflecting_sunlight , but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth .
 albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , such_as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial_airliner traffic . a study following the burning of the kuwaiti_oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as °c_colder than temperatures several miles_away under clear_skies .
 aerosol effects
 aerosols ( very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere ) have both direct and indirect_effects on earth ' s radiative_balance . the direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect_effect ( the particles act as cloud_condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain . as per the effects are
 aerosol direct effect . aerosols directly scatter and absorb_radiation . the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling , whereas absorption can cause atmospheric_warming .
 aerosol indirect_effect . aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud_condensation nuclei . increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud_droplet number concentrations , which in turn leads to increased cloud_albedo , increased light_scattering and radiative_cooling ( first indirect_effect ) , but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud ( second indirect_effect ) .
 black carbon
 another albedo - related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles . the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental_panel on climate_change estimates that the global mean radiative_forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil_fuels is + . w_m− , with a range + . to + . w_m− . black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar_ice cap in the arctic than carbon_dioxide due to its effect on the albedo . james hansen the efficacy of this forcing is » ( i . e . , for a given forcing it is twice as effective as co in altering global surface air temperature ) ) compare zender testimony , supra note , at ( figure ) see j . hansen the efficacy for changes of arctic sea ice albedo is > . in additional runs not shown here , we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in antarctica is also > . ) see_also flanner , m . g . , c . s . zender , j . t . randerson , and p . j . rasch , present - day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow , j . geophys . res . d ( ) ( the forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset , triggering strong snow - albedo_feedback in local springtime . consequently , the efficacy of black carbon/snow forcing is more_than three times greater_than forcing by co . ) .
 human activities
 human activities ( e . g . , deforestation , farming , and urbanization ) change the albedo of various areas around the globe . however , quantification of this effect on the global_scale is difficult .
 other types of albedo
 single - scattering_albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic_waves on small particles . it depends_on properties of the material ( refractive_index ) the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming_radiation .

 ' a ' ( named , plural as , a ' s , a s , a ' s or aes ) is the first letter and the first vowel of the iso basic latin_alphabet . it is similar to the ancient_greek letter alpha , from which it derives . the upper - case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal_bar . the lower - case version can be written in two forms the double - storey ' a ' and single - storey ' ɑ ' . the latter is commonly_used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts intended to be read by children , and is also found in italic_type .
 the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph ( also written ' aleph ) , the first letter of the phoenician_alphabet , which consisted_entirely of consonants ( for that reason , it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ) . in turn , the ancestor of aleph may have_been a pictogram of an ox head in proto - sinaitic_script influenced_by egyptian_hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended .
 by bc , the phoenician_alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms . its name is thought to have corresponded_closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph .
 when the ancient_greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant_sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic_languages , and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha . in the earliest greek_inscriptions after the greek dark_ages , dating to the th_century bc , the letter rests_upon its side , but in the greek_alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set .
 the etruscans brought the greek_alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged . the romans later adopted the etruscan_alphabet to write the latin language , and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin_alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including english .
 typographic_variants
 of the lowercase_letter a .
 during roman times , there were many variant_forms of the letter a . first was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media . there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces . due to the perishable_nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental , but there are still many surviving_examples of different_types of cursive , such_as majuscule cursive , minuscule_cursive , and semicursive minuscule . variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive_styles . the known variants include the early semi - uncial , the uncial , and the later semi - uncial .
 include a double - storey ' a ' and single - storey ' ɑ ' . at the end of the roman_empire ( th_century ad ) , several variants of the cursive_minuscule developed through western_europe . among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy , the merovingian_script in france , the visigothic_script in spain , and the insular or anglo - irish semi - uncial or anglo - saxon majuscule of great_britain . by the th_century , the caroline script , which was very_similar to the present - day form , was the principal form used in book - making , before the advent of the printing_press . this form was derived through a combining of prior forms .
 th - century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today . these variants , the italic and roman forms , were derived_from the caroline script version . the italic form , also called script a , is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke . this slowly developed from the fifth - century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers . the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ( a ) . both derive_from the majuscule ( capital ) form . in greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal_stroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown . many fonts then made the right leg vertical . in some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting in the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form .
 italic_type is commonly_used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest ( set in roman type ) . there are some other cases aside_from italic_type where script a ( ɑ ) , also called latin alpha , is used in contrast with latin a ( such_as in the international_phonetic alphabet ) .
 use in writing systems
 in modern english orthography , the letter represents at_least seven different vowel_sounds
 the near - open front_unrounded vowel as in pad
 the open back_unrounded vowel as in father , which is closer to its original latin and greek sound
 the diphthong as in ace and major ( usually when is followed by one , or occasionally two , consonants and then another vowel letter ) – this results from middle english lengthening followed by the great vowel_shift
 the modified form of the above sound that occurs before , as in square and mary
 the rounded_vowel of water
 the shorter rounded_vowel ( not present in general american ) in was and what
 a schwa , in many unstressed_syllables , as in about , comma , solar .
 the double sequence does_not occur in native english words , but is found in some words derived_from foreign_languages such_as aaron and aardvark . however , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their_own sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and .
 is the third - most - commonly_used letter in english ( after and ) , and the second most_common in spanish and french . in one study , on average , about . % of letters used in english texts tend to be , while the number is . % in spanish and . % in french .
 other languages
 in most languages that use the latin_alphabet , denotes an open unrounded_vowel , such_as , , or . an exception is saanich , in which ( and the glyph á ) stands for a close - mid front_unrounded vowel .
 other systems
 in phonetic and phonemic_notation
 in the international_phonetic alphabet , }} is used for the open front_unrounded vowel , }} is used for the open central_unrounded vowel , and }} is used for the open back_unrounded vowel .
 in x - sampa , is used for the open front_unrounded vowel and is used for the open back_unrounded vowel .
 other uses
 in algebra , the letter a along_with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities , whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet ( x , y , z ) are used to denote unknown quantities .
 in geometry , capital a , b , c etc . are used to denote segments , lines , rays , etc . a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a .
 a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a - , a or a+ , the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork a grade for clean restaurants a - list celebrities , etc . such associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter a has_been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters .
 finally , the letter a is used to denote size , as in a narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere .

 while anti - statism is central , anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical_organisation in the conduct of all human relations . anarchism is usually considered a far - left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti - authoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism or participatory_economics .
 anarchism does_not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy . many types and traditions of anarchism exist , not all of which are mutually_exclusive . anarchist schools of thought can differ_fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme_individualism to complete collectivism . strains of anarchism have often been divided_into the categories of social and individualist_anarchism or similar dual classifications .
 etymology and terminology
 the word is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix - ism , themselves derived respectively from the greek , i . e . anarchy ( from , anarchos , meaning one without rulers from the privative_prefix ἀν - ( an - , i . e . without ) and , archos , i . e . leader , ruler ( cf . archon or , arkhē , i . e . authority , sovereignty , realm , magistracy ) ) and the suffix or ( - ismos , - isma , from the verbal_infinitive suffix - ίζειν , - izein ) . the first known use of this word was in . various_factions within the french_revolution labelled opponents as anarchists ( as robespierre did the hébertists ) although few shared many views of later anarchists . there would be many revolutionaries of the early_nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next_generation , such_as william_godwin and wilhelm_weitling , but they did_not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs .
 the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre - joseph_proudhon , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid - nineteenth_century . since the s , and beginning in france , the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost_exclusively in this sense until the s in the united_states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united_states . on the other_hand , some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free - market philosophy only , referring to free - market_anarchism as libertarian_anarchism .
 document by william_everard
 the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th_century bc among the works of taoist_philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao_jingyan . zhuangzi ' s philosophy has_been described by various sources as anarchist . zhuangzi wrote a petty_thief is put in jail . a great becomes a ruler of a nation . diogenes of sinope and the cynics , as well as their contemporary zeno of citium , the founder of stoicism , also introduced similar topics . jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition . georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus_christ and . . . the first anarchist society was that of the apostles . in early islamic history , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil_war over the caliphate , where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society .
 the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de_la boétie wrote in his most_famous work the discourse on voluntary_servitude what some historians_consider an important anarchist precedent . the radical protestant_christian gerrard_winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th_century in england . the term anarchist first entered the english language in , during the english civil_war , as a term of abuse , used by royalists against their roundhead opponents . by the time of the french_revolution some , such_as the enragés , began to use the term positively , in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power , seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic . by the turn of the th_century , the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative_connotation .
 modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment , particularly jean - jacques_rousseau ' s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
 as part of the political_turmoil of the s in the wake of the french_revolution , william_godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought . godwin was , according to peter_kropotkin , the first to formulate the political and economical_conceptions of anarchism , even_though he did_not give that name to the ideas developed in his work , while godwin attached his anarchist_ideas to an early edmund_burke .
 godwin is generally_regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as ' philosophical_anarchism ' . he argued in political justice ( ) that government has an inherently malevolent_influence on society , and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance . he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither_away as an unnecessary force . although he did_not accord the state with moral_legitimacy , he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power . rather , he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution .
 his aversion to the imposition of a rules - based society led him to denounce , as a manifestation of the people ' s ' mental_enslavement ' , the foundations of law , property_rights and even the institution of marriage . he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually_beneficial method of social organisation . in each case , government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance_with the full and free exercise of private judgement .
 the french pierre - joseph_proudhon is regarded_as the first self - proclaimed_anarchist , a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work , what is property ? , published in . it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist_theory . he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society , where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its_own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their_own interests . his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order . in what is property ? proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft . in this work , he opposed the institution of decreed property ( propriété ) , where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish . he contrasted this with what he called possession , or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use . later , however , proudhon added that property is liberty and argued_that it was a bulwark_against state power . his opposition to the state , organised religion , and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists , and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time .
 the anarcho - communist joseph_déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian . unlike pierre - joseph_proudhon , he argued_that , it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature . in in germany the post - hegelian_philosopher max_stirner published the book , the ego and its_own , which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist_anarchism . french anarchists active in the revolution included anselme_bellegarrigue , ernest coeurderoy , joseph_déjacque and pierre joseph_proudhon .
 first international and the paris_commune
 opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion , and allied_himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists .
 in europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long - term social_upheaval as groups carried_out nationalist_uprisings . after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took_advantage of the divided groups of socialists , anarchists , liberals , and nationalists , to prevent further revolt . in spain ramón de_la sagra established the anarchist journal el_porvenir in la_coruña in which was inspired_by proudhon´s ideas . the catalan politician francesc_pi i_margall became the principal translator of proudhon ' s works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party . according to george_woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting_effect on the development of spanish anarchism after , but before that time proudhonian_ideas , as interpreted by pi , already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist_movement which sprang_up in the early ' s . according to the encyclopædia_britannica during the spanish revolution of , pi y_margall attempted to establish a decentralised , or cantonalist , political system on proudhonian_lines .
 in the international_workingmen ' s association ( sometimes_called the first international ) united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon , blanquists , philadelphes , english trade_unionists , socialists and social_democrats . due to its links to active workers ' movements , the international became a significant organisation . karl_marx became a leading_figure in the international and a member of its general council . proudhon ' s followers , the mutualists , opposed marx ' s state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . woodcock also reports that the american individualist_anarchists lysander_spooner and william b . greene had_been members of the first international . in , following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom ( lpf ) , russian revolutionary mikhail_bakunin and his collectivist_anarchist associates joined the first international ( which had decided not to get involved with the lpf ) . they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of t
